The Cub3D project is a simple 3D game engine using the raycasting technique for 42 School's curriculum.

# Description

This project requires you to create a simple 3D game engine using the raycasting technique, which was popularized by the game Wolfenstein 3D. The engine should be able to render a 3D map, display sprites, and handle user input for movement and rotation.

The project is written in the C programming language, and uses the Minilibx library for graphical display.

# Installation

To install and run the Cub3D project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Run the make command to compile the project.

Run the executable with the ./Cub3D maps/map.cub command, where /maps/map.cub is the path to the map file you want to load.

# Usage

The CUB3D project is designed to demonstrate basic 3D game engine programming using the raycasting technique. To use the project, follow these steps:

Run the ./Cub3D maps/map.cub command to load and render the map.

Use the arrow keys to move forward, backward, and turn left or right.

Use the ESC key to exit the game.
