CUB3D Project

The CUB3D project is a simple 3D game engine using the raycasting technique for 42 School's curriculum.

Description

This project requires you to create a simple 3D game engine using the raycasting technique, which was popularized by the game Wolfenstein 3D. The engine should be able to render a 3D map, display sprites, and handle user input for movement and rotation.

The project is written in the C programming language, and uses the Minilibx library for graphical display.

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Run the make command to compile the project.

Run the executable with the ./Cub3D [map_file] command, where [map_file] is the path to the map file you want to load.
